# What questions to ask before starting to code ?
- None

# Idea
- Iterate with two pointers.
	- One zero pointer, which always points to the first position of a zero element.
	- Non-zero pointer, which always points to the first position of a non-zero element.
    - while these pointers are not equal swap the values at the respective pointers and update the pointers.
- be careful that, the non-zero pointer should always follow the zero pointer.
