1: two isolated vertices (sol=0)
2: a cycle of four vertices. (sol=1)
3: a pseudoforest of two (pseudo)trees (sol=1)
4: a complete graph of six vertices, sol = 3
5-25: each a randomly sampled subgraph of the preprocessed LiveJournal graph (~34M edges) from the SNAP database.
26: sampled induced subgraph of the DBLP graph (rather high solution of 25)
27: Even and Tarjan's 'worst-case' example for a snuggly m=3
28-30: sampled induced subgraphs of K_10
31: The complete graphs K_1, K_2, ..., K_17, two successive K_i, K_{i+1} are additionally linked completely.
32: the same as #32, but up to K_20 and sampled to have at most 2500 edges.
